\chapter{Introduction}
% 1-3 pages
% It's a good idea to try to write the introduction to your final report early on in the project. 
% However, you will find it hard, as you won’t yet have a complete story and you won’t know what your main contributions are going to be. 
% However, the exercise is useful as it will tell you what you don’t yet know and thus what questions your project should aim to answer. 
% For the interim report this section should be a short, succinct, summary of the project’s main objectives. 
% Some of this material may be re-usable in your final report, but the chances are that your final introduction will be quite different.  
% You are therefore advised to keep this part of the interim report short, focusing on the following questions: What is the problem, why is it interesting and what’s your main idea for solving it?  
% (DON'T use those three questions as subheadings however!  The answers should emerge from what you write.)

The utilisation of drones (Unmaned Aerial Vehicles) in diverse applications, in particular for data collection in hard-to-reach areas, has gained significant attention~\cite{droneReview}.
In a dense forest environment, drones have the ability to navigate faster with less disturbance to the surroudning environment.
This can allow for very efficient data collection for a variety of tasks \cite{environmentalSensing} such as autonomous sensor placement, wherein a sensor is placed in a forest environment for a long period of time.

One of the major limitations of the widespread adoption of UAVs for long-term environmental sensing is their limited flight time.
This is inherently constrained by their limited battery capacity and the substantial power required to sustain flight~\cite{droneBattery}.
Naive attempts at increasing battery capacity lead to an increase in weight carried by the UAV, which in turn reduces the total flight time.
Current strategies to extend the flight time involve advancements in battery technology to increase battery capacity with the same weight.
Another potential solution is allowing the UAV to collect energy during its operation either through incorporating solar cells to allow for the capture of energy during flight \cite{droneSunlight} or by stopping and recharging at regular intervals.
However, these approaches rely on good environmental conditions which are difficult due to the absence of light in dense forest environments.

Alternatively to increasing battery capacity, the power required can be reduced.
However, this approach is still limited due to the theoretical minimum energy required to provide lift, which is required to keep the drone in the air.
Another approach involves grounding the UAV temporarily, effectively pausing the flight to conserve energy.
This strategy could involve the drone performing environmental sensing tasks from the ground.
Yet, this poses a risk to the UAV of potential damage from unsafe landing areas or interference from wildlife.
Additionally it might disturb the environment more than aerial sensing, potentially compromising data integrity.

Taking inspiration from birds in nature another approach would be perching the UAV upon a branch.
This which would allow for effective sensing of the environment while reducing the impact on results and protecting the drone.
This approach allows for silent operation allowing for the observation of wildlife.
The majority of the current literature focuses on mechanical attachment methods, however the reliance of complex hardware poses significant challenges.

This project aims to generate agile trajectories for tethered drone perching.
A tethered drone employs a pendulum mechanism, including a rope of length $l$ with a weight at one end, allowing the pendulum to move freely as shown in Figure.~\ref{fig:intro-tethered-drone}.

For perching on a tree, the drone's tether system is designed to wrap around a target branch as shown in Figure.~\ref{fig:intro-wrapping}.
This process is further explained in Section 2.1.

One of the major challenges encountered in previous work in the area was in simulation.
It was difficult to simulate the pendulum and all of the forces exerted on it.
Additionally modelling the tether wrapping around the branch proved to be extremely difficult.
Therefore several assumptions had to be made that didn't necessarily prove to be correct when done on real data.
Some simulations were carried out without the tether being present, it was noted that this seemed oversimplified and caused trajectories to be generated that were infeasible.
This therefore motivates the need for an algorithm that can learn from real-world non-simulated environments quickly and safely.

In previous work, a single demonstration, target trajectory, was used to speed up training.
However the major limitation with this type of reinforcement learning agent is the reliance on the ability of the demonstration, it assumes the demonstration is perfect or near perfect which is usually not the case for real-world demonstrations.
Traditional RL algorithms have shown a limited ability to improve upon demonstrations and struggle to perform well on non-expert or detrimental demonstrations.

This motivates the learning of trajectories from non-expert demonstrations.
This project aims to design and implement a framework for learning agile perching trajectories from non-expert demonstrations.
This work therefore fits into the intersection between Imitation Learning (IR) and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
