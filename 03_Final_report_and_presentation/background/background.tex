\chapter{Background}
% 10-20 pages
% This should form the bulk of the interim report. 
% You should consider that your objective here is to produce a near final version of the background section, as it will appear in your final report. 
% All of this material should be re-usable, so it is worth getting it right at this stage of the project.  
% The details of what to include can be found in the Project Report guidelines.
