\chapter{Evaluation Plan}
% Evaluation plan (1-2 pages)
% Project evaluation is very important, so it's important to think now about how you plan to measure success. 
% For example, what functionality do you need to demonstrate?  
% What experiments to you need to undertake and what outcome(s) would constitute success?  
% What benchmarks should you use? How has your project extended the state of the art?  How do you measure qualitative aspects, such as ease of use?  These are the sort of questions that your project evaluation should address; this section should outline your plan.
