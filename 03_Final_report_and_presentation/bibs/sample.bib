    abstract = "{The current work is a development of an interface to control a wireless drone for home security applications. A review had been done for the categorization of drones and drones’ trend for recent years. It was found that drones were basically categorized by weight and flight range and number of drones increased by leaps and bounds from year 2003 to year 2017. The history of drones and recent-year-founded applications were being reviewed as well. A research was being done on 19 types of drones which are available in current market such as DJI Phantom 4 and GoPro Karma and their applications. To the summary of the review, drones’ technology will be advancing with the current rate of development of technology and it will be more applicable to our daily life in the future. Proposed future research pathways on drone’s technology and their applications were being done as well to understand the future trend and possible advancement for drones.}",

ABSTRACT = {The practically applicable endurance estimation method for multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using a battery as a power source is proposed. The method considers both hovering and steady-level flights. The endurance, thrust, efficiency, and battery discharge are determined with generally available data from the manufacturer. The effects of the drag coefficient related to vehicle shape and payload weight are examined at various forward flight speeds. As the drag coefficient increases, the optimum speed at the minimum required power and the maximum endurance are reduced. However, the payload weight causes an opposite effect, and the optimal flying speed increases with an increase in the payload weight. For more practical applications for common users, the value of S &times; Cd is determined from a preliminary flight test. Given this value, the endurance is numerically estimated and validated with the measured flight time. The proposed method can successfully estimate the flight time with an average error of 2.3%. This method would be useful for designers who plan various missions and select UAVs.},

@article{droneSunlight,
abstract = {Sunlight energy is potentially excellent for small drones, which can often operate during daylight hours and fly high enough to avoid cloud blockade. However, the best solar cells provide limited power, compared to conventional power sources, making their use for aerial vehicles difficult to realize, especially in rotorcraft where significant lift ordinarily generated by a wing is already sacrificed for the ability to hover. In recent years, advances in materials (use of carbon‐fiber components, improvement in specific solar cells and motors) have finally brought solar rotorcraft within reach. Here, the application is explored through a concise mathematical model of solar rotorcraft based on the limits of solar power generation and motor power consumption. Multiple solar quadcopters based on this model with majority solar power are described. One of them has achieved an outdoor airtime over 3 hours, 48 times longer than it can last on just battery alone with the solar cells carried as dead weight and representing a significant prolongation of drone operation. Solar‐power fluctuations during long flight and their interaction with power requirements are experimentally characterized. The general conclusion is that solar cells have reached high enough efficiencies and can outperform batteries under the right conditions for quadcopters.
A quadcopter using on‐board solar module to harvest sunlight outdoors achieves over 3 h airtime, the longest for quadcopters without using chemical fuels and about 48 times more than using battery only. The accumulated charge generated from sunlight is 33 300 mAh, which would require a battery much heavier than the solar module and beyond the thrust capability to carry.},
