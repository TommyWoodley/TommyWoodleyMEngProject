# Agile Trajectory Generation for Tensile Perching with Aerial Robots

---
# Progress Update
Main focus is around Interim Report

- Introduction - 1st draft stage
- Background - Approx 70% Complete
  - Perching Tecniques - TODO
  - Existing Work - Done
  - Reinforcement Learning - 2nd draft stage
  - Inverse Reinforcement Learning - 1st draft stage
  - Reinforcement Learning from Demonstration - half 1st draft, half in note form
- Project Plan - in note form
- Evaluation Plan - TODO

---
# Project Aim
- Design and Implement a Framework for Learning Agile Perching Trajectories from Non-Expert Demonstrations.
  - Using a small number of demonstrations to perform the required task.
  - Following demonstrations the agent should improve energy efficiency while still completing the perching task.
  - Not following a target trajectory - instead the agent will need to understand the goal of the task (IRL).

# Plans Until Next
- Largely be focussed on the Interim Deadline for the next 2 weeks

---
# Questions
- Experimental Ability - How does this get organised?
- When will we find out 2nd markers?
